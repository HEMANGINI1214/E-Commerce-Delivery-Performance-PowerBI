E-Commerce Delivery Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

Executive Summary
This project showcases interactive Power BI dashboard development for analyzing delivery performance of an e-commerce company. It helps stakeholders understand key delivery metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize logistics strategies.

Business Problem
E-commerce companies rely heavily on delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. Slow or unreliable delivery leads to:
- Poor customer experience
- Higher return rates

- Delivery partners
- Regions / zones
- Status (delivered, delayed, returned)
This dataset facilitates analysis of delivery performance across multiple dimensions.

Data Preparation
Prior to dashboard creation:
- Data cleaning and validation were performed
- Date columns formatted
- Delivery partner and region attributes standardized
- Calculated measures created using DAX
This ensured accurate visualization of delivery KPIs.
